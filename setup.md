# Setup

_Petite_ uses annotation based configuration to make setup and configuration simple as possible. It doesn't depend on any external \(XML\) files; by default all configuration is done automagically, from Java. Nevertheless, it is easy to configure and extend _Petite_ to match any requirements.

### Bean Iteration

At any time, all registered beans may be iterated. This is useful when some additional modification has to be performed on bean classes, after being registered. Method `beansIterator` iterates all beans - actually, it iterates all bean definitions! This means that beans may not be even initialized yet \(there was no first lookup yet\).

### Configuration

_Petite_ container is quite configurable. Configuration is available via method `config()`.

#### defaultScope

Default scope for beans registration, when explicit scope is not specified. Default value: `SingletonScope.class`.

#### defaultWiringMode

Defines default wiring mode. Can be one of the following:

* `WiringMode.NONE` - no wiring,
* `WiringMode.STRICT` - throws an exception if injection failes

  \(default\),

* `WiringMode.OPTIONAL` - ignores unsuccessful injections
* `WiringMode.AUTOWIRE` - tries to wire all fields

Mode can be changed during runtime, although this is not recommended.

#### detectDuplicatedBeanNames

Flag for detecting duplicated bean names during registration \(`false` by default\). If set to `true`, _Petite_ will throw an exception if bean with the same name already exists in the container.

#### resolveReferenceParameters

Flag for resolving parameter references \(`true` by default\). _Petite_ parameters can define a value that contains value of other parameter. For example: `defineParameter("name", "${name2}");` will define parameter **name** with value equals to value of other parameter, **name2**.

#### useFullTypeNames

Defines what will be the default bean name, when no explicit name is provided. If set to `false` \(default\), uncapitalized simple type name will be used as bean name \(for example, `app.service.SomeService` will be named as `someService`\).

If set to `true`, then full bean type name will be used as bean name.

#### lookupReferences

Defines reference lookup order. When looking up for a bean reference, _Petite_ may look for it in different ways. By default, the lookup order is the following:

* `PetiteReference.NAME`
* `PetiteReference.TYPE_SHORT_NAME`
* `PetiteReference.TYPE_FULL_NAME`

User may change or modify this lookup order.

#### useParamo

When set to `true` \(default\), _Petite_ will use _Paramo_ to extract constructor and method argument names - this information is not provided by java reflection API and must be read from debug information in bytecode. If set to `false`, injection by name will not be available for constructor and method arguments.

# Petite

**Petite** is one great little **IoC** container and components manager. _Petite_ is easy to use since it requires no external configuration; it is incredibly fast, lightweight and super-small; so anyone can quickly grasp how it works. _Petite_ is quite extensible and open for customization; and non-invasive.

### Quick Overview

The following bean shows some basic _Petite_ usage:

```java
@PetiteBean
public class Foo {

    // dependency injected in the ctor
    @PetiteInject
    public Foo(ServiceOne one) {...}

    // dependency injected in a field
    @PetiteInject("serviceTwo")
    ServiceTwo two;

    // dependency injected with the method
    @PetiteInject
    public void injectService(ServiceThree three) {...}

    // dependency injected with the method
    public void injectService(
        @PetiteInject ServiceFour four) {...}

    // initialization method
    @PetiteInitMethod
    public void init() {...}

    public void foo() {
    }
}
```

`Foo` is _Petite_ bean that defines several _injection points_, for different depending services from the container. Put this bean in the classpath and let `PetiteContainer` find it and register as a bean. Or register it manually if you like that way more.

### Why should I use it?

**Petite** is one of the lightest Java DI container around. Still, it supports sufficient most of features offered by other containers.

Here are the key features:

* property, method and constructor injection points.
* Instance life-cycle management, ordered initialization methods.
* Adding external objects to container.
* Wiring external objects with container's context.
* Creating objects by container.
* Automatic registration: no XML or code needed, just annotations.
* Programmatic configuration: using plain Java.
* Scopes: Prototype, Singleton and custom scopes.
* Thread local scope for thread singletons.
* HTTP session scope for session singletons.
* Designed to be extended.
